Overview
--------

Gnudo is a wildly unfinished To-Do list app accessible on the terminal with a name pertaining to wildebeest.

It's written in [Swift](swift.org) with its ArgumentParser, stores the task data in json, and wants help deciding where on the UNIX-like file system to put the data. (and its backup!)

How to Help
-----------

To help develop the thing you can clone the GitHub repo into a new directory with `git clone https://github.com/thegnugod/gnudo NEW_DIRECTORY_NAME`
